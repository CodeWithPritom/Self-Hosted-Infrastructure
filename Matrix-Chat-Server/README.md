# Secure Chat Infrastructure with Matrix Synapse

This module documents the deployment of a decentralized, secure messaging server using **Matrix Synapse**.

### 🛠 Why Matrix?
I implemented Matrix to create a private, self-hosted communication channel that doesn't rely on third-party providers like WhatsApp or Discord.

### 🚀 Implementation Details
- **Server:** Matrix Synapse (Optimized for DietPi).
- **Client:** Element (Connected via private homeserver).
- **Encryption:** End-to-end encryption enabled for all rooms.

### 🔒 Security Integration
The Matrix server is integrated into the local infrastructure and managed via the DietPi software stack, ensuring minimal resource usage while maintaining high security.

### 💡 Key Learning
- Understanding federated communication protocols.
- Managing homeserver configurations and user authentication.
